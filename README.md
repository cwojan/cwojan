## Hello!

My name is Chris Wojan and I am an ecology PhD Candidate at the University of Minnesota (and a wannabe Tetris master).

Particularly, I am interested in the spatial dynamics of host-parasite interactions, particularly with multi-host, environmental macroparasites.

On GitHub, I mostly create repositories for my data analysis and modeling work in R, as well as publish educational Quarto Books to the web. However, I am working on expanding my skills to other languages and project types!
